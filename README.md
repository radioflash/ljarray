# LJArray

LuaJIT module for dynamic-size cdata-arrays.

## Usage

```lua
local ljarray = require'ljarray'

-- obtain array-constructor-function
local intarray = ljarray.int

-- instantiate array (argument is initial array capacity)
local v = intarray(10)

print(#v) --> (-1) length operator is intended for Lua-for-loops

for i=0,5 do
  v[i] = i
end

print(#v) --> 5 length operator returns highest valid index
print(v[6]) --> out of bounds-access returns nil
```

## API

**``array_constructor = ljarray(ct [,gc_element])``**

The table returned by require'ljarray' is callable and works as factory-
function. When a `gc_element`- function is supplied, ljarray *always*
creates a new array_constructor on every call; constructors for `plain`
arrays are cached, on the other hand, and subsequent calls with the same
`ct` parameter will return the same array_constructor.

Note: If you pass a non-string ct parameter, make sure its always the same
object or caching won't work.

**``array = array_constructor([capacity])``**

Actually instantiates an array. Creates an empty array if no `capacity`
parameter is supplied.

## Array methods

**``array:reserve(capacity)``**

Reserves space for at least `capacity` elements.

**``array:shrink()``**

Shrinks array so that no more than the current element count fits in.

**``array:clear([gc_element])``**

Frees all elements.
If the `gc_element` parameter is boolean `false`, no finalizer is called.
Otherwise, `gc_element` is used a finalizer on all cleared array elements.
If `gc_element` is nil, the finalizer supplied on array-type construction (if
any) is used.

Note: array may be used/refilled after `clear`-ing.

**``#array``**

Returns the highest element-index, or -1 if the array is empty.
This is basically (array.cnt-1), but guaranteed to be a Lua-number.

**``array:insert([pos], element)``**

Inserts an element at `pos`. 
`pos` defaults to #array + 1.
If there are elements after the insertion-position, they are moved.

Elements between the previous end of the array and `pos` are implicitly
initialized.

**``array[pos] = element``**

Behavior is identical to array.insert, except that elements are finalized
and replaced (if a finalizer is set) instead of shoved back.

Like array.insert, this will trigger implicit initialization of elements
if `pos` is bigger than #array + 1.

**``element = array[pos]``**

Returns the element at `pos`. Returns nil if `pos` is out-of-bounds.

**``tostring(array)``**

Prints element-type, current element count and current capacity.

## Garbage collection

Array is `clear`-ed on finalization.

Note: If the array was supplied with a finalizer for its elements, it
will take ownership of any elements that are inserted, and disable any
finalizer on them (!!).
